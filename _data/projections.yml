#     slr: <optional description relative to sea level rise>
#   # e.g. in _data/scenarios.yml
#   index: <0-based index of this projection in numeric lists>

- id: high
  label: high end
  description:
    general: >
      This is the high-end projection. It features the most
      extreme increases in sea level.
  index: 2
- id: median
  label: mid range

  index: 1
- id: low
  label: low end
  description:
    general: >
      This is the low-end projection. It features the mildest
      increases in sea level and represents the lowest-impact
